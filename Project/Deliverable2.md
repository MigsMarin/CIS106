# Deliverable 2
Sources to use. It is my first time using Linux in such a detailed manner. Many of the sources that I will use to complete the project will come from the notes I have taken from the class, slideshows, and labs. Also, I will be using Linux forums to ask for questions to other users if I come across any problems. The official Ubuntu page is also able to provide information for commands and their functionalities. The main technology that I will use for this project is my laptop since I cannot afford a raspberry pi at the moment and it is where I have originally installed Virtual Box.
