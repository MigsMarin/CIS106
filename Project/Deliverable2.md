Some of the websites that I will use to work on are opensource.com and HowtoForge.com since they are, from what I have found, good sources for acquiring information for projects like this and setting up servers with Linux. The technologies I will be using are both a desktop computer and a laptop (Thinkpad). Also, I will use a USB drive to save my progress in the project, and finally, the most essential part of the project is using the software and the Linux OS to set up the server.
