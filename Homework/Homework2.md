# Homework 2

What are the advantages of open source?
* The main advantages of open source are that you have the freedom to do whatever you want with the software nad or hardware that you utilize.
* You can pick and choose whatever necessary extensions to the software you want since you are able to control how it will work.
* The creator of the software or hardware has no say in what you can do with the product.
* constant updates to the products since it is worked by multiple people at once all the time.

What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
* The ability to alter it
* The freedom to redistribute it
* No restrictions from the creator whatsoever

Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?
* Open source software is accompanied by the collaboration of hundreds of people working on software to at the same time to constantly improve it. People should use open source software to be able to fully own the product that they purchased or installed. Many of the proprietary developers of software block and limit the actions available to the user even after the user has paid to own it. Overall open source software gives the users the freedom they deserve when using software that they own without any sort of restrictions.

Watch the following video: Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.

I agree with Stallman. The user should be able to have total freedom when using software that they own. Being controlled by a live service that basically strips away the freedom from the user since it is being run from a server should not be a problem in general. The user should be the king of the software they own and should be able to maintain power over it at all times.
